# 🔁 Recursion & Backtracking

This folder contains my solutions to **Recursion and Backtracking problems** from **Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet**.

All problems are implemented in **C++** with an emphasis on:
- clear base cases  
- correct recursive flow  
- backtracking where required

## 📌 Problems Covered

Some of the key problems solved here include:

- Word Search 
- N-Queens Problem  
- Sudoku Solver  
- Combination Sum III

## 🧠 What I Learned from Recursion

Working on these problems helped me develop:
- Strong understanding of **base cases**
- Ability to visualize **recursion trees**
- Proper use of **backtracking (do → recurse → undo)**
- Writing clean and readable recursive code
